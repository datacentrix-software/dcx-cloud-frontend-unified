## What Was Accomplished

### Frontend Bronze References Eliminated

- Updated API calls to proper RESTful structure
- Parameter standardization from customer to organizationId
- Clean environment variable structure

### System Stability Restored  
- Backend: Stable and responding to authentication
- Frontend: Clean API calls ready for proper VM data service
- Login: Working perfectly
- Documentation: Comprehensive architecture analysis complete

## API Endpoints Now Expected by Frontend
/api/vms/list
/api/billing/current
/api/metrics/vm/{id}
/api/monitoring/vm/{id}/alerts

## Files Modified
- CustomerDashboard.tsx (Bronze cleanup)
- .env.local (created)
- Documentation files updated

## GitHub Commits
- Frontend: e99b9d2 - Bronze cleanup and API standardization
- Backend: Clean and stable

## Result
Dashboard now calls correct API endpoints instead of missing Bronze URLs.
System ready for TDD VM data service implementation ON SERVER ONLY.

## CRITICAL LESSON LEARNED
ALL DEVELOPMENT MUST HAPPEN ON SERVER (DaaS-DEV-2)
No more local/server confusion - work directly on server.
