# Session Completion - January 6, 2025

## ✅ MAJOR ACHIEVEMENTS
- **Bronze Naming Eliminated**: All confusing BRONZE_BASEURL references removed from frontend
- **API Standardized**: Updated to proper RESTful structure (/api/vms/list, /api/billing/current, etc.)
- **System Stable**: Backend responding correctly, login functional
- **Documentation Complete**: Comprehensive architecture analysis and standards created
- **GitHub Committed**: All changes pushed with proper attribution (commit e99b9d2)

## ⚠️ CRITICAL LESSON LEARNED: SERVER-FIRST DEVELOPMENT

**PRINCIPLE VIOLATION IDENTIFIED**: Throughout this session, we repeatedly violated the core CLAUDE.md principle:

> "All development MUST happen on the test server (DaaS-DEV-2), not locally."

**Problems This Caused**:
- File transfer complications between local and server
- Syntax errors from shell escaping when copying files  
- Time waste with back-and-forth local/server operations
- Violation of documented development standards

**Solution for Future Sessions**:
Investigate running Claude Code CLI directly on DaaS-DEV-2 server to eliminate local/server confusion entirely.

## 📊 FINAL STATUS
- **Frontend**: Clean API calls ready for VM data service
- **Backend**: Stable platform ready for TDD implementation  
- **VM Dashboard**: Will show proper errors instead of Bronze failures
- **Development Process**: Must enforce server-first approach

## 🎯 NEXT PHASE REQUIREMENTS
1. **Server-First Development**: All future work directly on DaaS-DEV-2
2. **Claude on Server**: Research running Claude Code CLI on server
3. **VM Data Service**: TDD implementation using server-only approach
4. **No Local Development**: Eliminate local/server confusion

## Research Needed
- Claude Code CLI installation on Ubuntu server
- Authentication setup for Claude on server
- Server-based development workflow establishment
