# DCX Cloud Platform - Complete Business Specification

## Executive Summary & Platform Overview

The DCX Cloud Platform is a comprehensive multi-tenant cloud management system that enables resellers to provision, manage, and bill cloud services to their customers. The platform operates on a three-tier model: Datacentrix (root provider), Resellers (channel partners), and Customers (end users).

```

### Business Model & Commercial Framework

The platform operates on a wholesale-to-retail commercial model where:
- **Datacentrix** provides wholesale infrastructure and platform services
- **Resellers** purchase services at wholesale rates and sell to customers at retail rates
- **Customers** consume cloud services and pay retail rates
- **Commission Structure**: 7.5-12.5% margin for resellers based on volume commitments
